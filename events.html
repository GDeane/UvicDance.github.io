       <h3 id="spring-formal"> UVBLSC Annual General Meeting </h3>
      <div class="comment">
        <p>
         As you know, this school year is coming to an end and some of our Executive Members are graduating. We are looking for members of our club, who have been with us for at least a semester, 
         to fill these empty positions for the 2018/19 school year. We also encourage you to share your thoughts and feedback with us about the club.
        <p>
        You can run for positions like Vice-President, Events Coordinator, Equipment Manager and more! These positions will be voted on by those who attend the meeting.
       <p>
        Being an executive is an amazing and rewarding experience.  It’s a great way to share your love of dance with others. This is a great chance to step into a leadership role to help organize dances, 
         lessons, and events on campus! If you're not looking for an official position with a set of responsibilities, but would still like to attend meetings and help out, you can become a Member-at-Large. Your dance skill doesn’t matter!

            Welcome to the UVic Ballroom, Latin, and Swing Club (UVBLSC)! As a Vikes Rec
            Club, we believe that ballroom dancing improves physical and social
            wellbeing and enhances quality of life! We offer lessons not only
            in Standard Ballroom (like waltz, foxtrot, and tango), but also
            Latin Ballroom, East Coast Swing, Salsa, Merengue and Bachata.
            You don’t need a partner or any dance experience
            (having two left feet is fine), just show up and get ready to have
            fun, meet new people, and, of course, learn how to dance!.
