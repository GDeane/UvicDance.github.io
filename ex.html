          Hi everyone! <br/><br/>
          I joined the UVic ballroom dance club during my first year at the University of Victoria and I am
          extremely glad that I did. The UVic ballroom dance club has given me the opportunity to meet some
          really amazing people, have lots of fun, and learn a lifelong skill. Other than a few childhood dance
          classes, I had not done much dancing before I joined the club. Anyone with any level of dancing experience
          is welcome. I hope to see you out on the dance floor!

          I’m excited to say this will be my third year with the UVic Ballroom Club and being part of the Executive
          team. In my first year at UVic I really wanted to join at least one club so I could meet new people and
          get involved with the student life. UVic Ballroom turned out to be the perfect choice because it had the
          social aspect I was looking for, I got to learn a new skill and it was form of exercise! I always look
          forward to lessons each weekend, but the best part is being able to use the moves I’ve learned at UVic out
          in the community at dances like Swing City and Nothin’but Swing! I’ve always loved to dance, but now I’m
          addicted!<br/><br/>

          I’ve been involved in music and dance my whole life, and I joined the UVic BDC in the hopes of learning
          a new dance or two.  The club was so welcoming, and the lessons so much fun, that my love for ballroom
          dance quickly climbed to the level of “obsession”.  The club has given me joy and a place in a vibrant
          community.  When I’m not dancing, I spend my time working towards my Batchelor’s degree in Anthropology
          and reading far too many fantasy novels.

          I have been dancing my whole life. When I was 6 I finally started lessons, and haven't stopped since!
          Growing up, I mainly did ballet, with a few other dances (jazz, contemporary, musical theatre) thrown
          in for good measure. Now I've found ballroom and it's possibly the most fun I've ever had dancing.
          It's social, there is so much variety, and everyone in the club has always been incredibly welcoming.
          Whatever your skill level, come have fun!<br/><br/>

          These days I can be found at lessons on the weekends, Swing City on Friday nights, and twirling around
          campus when I think nobody is watching.

          This is my third year in the club and my first as part of the exec. I first joined the club to try something
          completely new to me. I had zero dancing experience before joining the club, but since then I've learned a
          lot and enjoyed it all the while, and I'm happy to now have the opportunity to give back to the club.
          Regardless of skill level, the club is a great place to come and have a good time. I hope to see you on the
          dance floor!

          I got my first camera Nikon D90 in 2009, this was because of the lack of a moment recorder in my family. So,
          I volunteered as a photographer for my family to cpature all the amazing moments we had. In 2010, I joined
          the journalism team in my highschool, which I earned 2 best photographer awards consecutively for the 2
          years that I was in it. It had given me a lot of chances to practice photoshooting under a stressful
          environment. Later on, I was lucky enough to become a board member in Dapper-Jumpsuit Production, and being
          able to build my connection around to start taking pictures for professional actors/actresses, stage events
          and eventually weddings.<br/><br/>

          Pictures do not just capture the moment, it captures the soul of everything within. So basically now I have
          had five years of professional experiences in different photography fields, and am currently focusing on
          actors/actresses headshots, events and weddings. I started Latin Dance when I was back at UBCO, and have
          accumilated 1.5 years of experience.<br/><br/>

          I joined the UVic Ballroom Dance Club in my first semester. Before joining the club, I had danced ballet
          and musical theater, but it was the first time I tried social dancing, and I'm glad that I did. The more
          I learn about dance, the more I enjoy it, and I predict that you will too. The Ballroom Dance Club is filled
          with a wonderful and diverse group of people who would like to be your friend. Join us and dance away the
          stress of school!<br/><br/>

            Welcome to the UVic Ballroom Dance Club (UVBDC)!  As a Vikes Rec
            Club, we believe that ballroom dancing improves physical and social
            wellbeing and enhances quality of life! We offer lessons not only
            in Standard Ballroom (like waltz, foxtrot, and tango), but also
            Latin Ballroom, East Coast Swing, Salsa, Merengue and Bachata.
            You don’t need a partner or any dance experience
            (having two left feet is fine), just show up and get ready to have
            fun, meet new people, and, of course, learn how to dance!.
