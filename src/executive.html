            I’m excited to say this will be my third year with the UVic 
            Ballroom Club and being part of the Executive team. In my first 
            year at UVic I really wanted to join at least one club so I 
            could meet new people and get involved with the student life. 
            UVic Ballroom turned out to be the perfect choice because it 
            had the social aspect I was looking for, I got to learn a new 
            skill and it was form of exercise! I always look forward to 
            lessons each weekend, but the best part is being able to use 
            the moves I’ve learned at UVic out in the community at dances 
            like Swing City and Nothin’but Swing! I’ve always loved to 
            dance, but now I’m addicted!<br><br>

            In my first year of university, I joined the UVic Ballroom Dance 
            Club, and I can suggest that you do to. Before joining the club, 
            I had never done Ballroom Dancing before, but the club was very 
            welcoming and I had lots of fun learning the different types of 
            dance. I also  made many friends in the club and I am happy to 
            now be helping out with the Club. I hope that everyone considers 
            joining the Ballroom Dance Club, as it is a great experience!
