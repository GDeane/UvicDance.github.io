        The UVic Ballroom, Latin, and Swing Club is run by a group of volunteer students. They hire professional instructors
        to teach classes, they plan events and workshops. If you are interested in joining the executive and helping
        run the club, please talk to one of the executives or email us at ballroom@uvicdance.com!

          I have been with the club since my very first semester at UVic, and
          before joining the club, I had never attended a dance lesson in my life! The only exposure I had to dancing
          was from musical theatre in high school, and on several occasions I was cut from the dance numbers because I was so bad!
          So if you are on the fence about checking us out because you are worried you won't be good enough, I can promise you that 
          it is such a safe and welcoming environment, and that everyone is there to learn, not show off. I am ecstatic about classes
          returning this fall, and hope to see many familiar (and just as many new) faces there.

        <p>
          I have always loved music, and before getting into dance, I could often be found practicing the trombone, singing karaoke, or just jamming out to my favourite tunes.
          When I was in my first year of university, I joined the club because of my interest in swing dancing. 
          As fun as that was, I found myself entirely captivated by salsa, and before I knew it, I was coming exclusively to the UVic Salsa Performance Team!
          I have now found my passion in dance and I am on dance teams that give me the opportunity to dance several hours every day, as well as travel around the world to perform.
          Even if you don't have a musical background, this club is absolutely worth joining! <br><br>
          I hope to see you on the dancefloor!

          Hello there! When I’m not dancing, I’m a second year studying history at UVIC. 
          This is my second year with the club and I’m ecstatic to be part of the UVBLSC exec team again! 
          This club allowed me to rediscover my love for dance and I’ve formed some truly wonderful friendships in the process. 
          Regardless of if you’ve got no dance experience or have been dancing your entire life, this club is the place for you! 
          We hope you’ll come dance with us!

        Hi! I’m a third year microbiology student at UVic, and this is my second year with the club.
          Joining the UVic Ballroom, Latin, and Swing Club was one of the best decisions I ever made! 
          I’ve always wanted to learn to dance, but never had the time or opportunity to… fortunately these classes fit in a busy schedule and are so much fun! 
          It’s been a great way to relax and meet many interesting people. 
          So whether you've danced before or not, we welcome you to come and give it a try!

        <p>
         I joined the club in my second year of university after doing a year of online classes due to COVID. 
          My previous exposure to dancing was hip hop back in middle school and years of musical theatre, but I immediately fell in love with the club. 
          Armed with no experience but brimming with enthusiasm, I learned huge amounts from the fantastic teachers of the club. 
          Salsa is a fantastic environment to get exercise, meet new people, and look fabulous in. 
          It’s the perfect activity for my weekends. Come dance! <br><br>
          If you want an extra promotion, less than a year after I joined the club, 
          I entered a Salsa competition with a senior member and came second place.

         Hi everyone, I’m Alex, a second year Electrical Engineering student. 
          This is my second semester with the club and my first on the executive team. 
          I only had marginal dance experience before joining the club although lots of experience in sports. 
          With dance, I have improved my physical coordination and confidence. 
          I felt safe and welcomed by the club and the executive team when I first started dancing. 
          On my first day of free classes with the club when everything was online I loved it so much that I immediately bought the membership.
