          Hi everyone! <br/><br/>
          I joined the UVic ballroom dance club during my first year at the University of Victoria and I am
          extremely glad that I did. The UVic ballroom dance club has given me the opportunity to meet some
          really amazing people, have lots of fun, and learn a lifelong skill. Other than a few childhood dance
          classes, I had not done much dancing before I joined the club. Anyone with any level of dancing experience
          is welcome. I hope to see you out on the dance floor!
        </p>

          In my first year of university, I joined the UVic Ballroom Dance Club, and I can suggest that you do to.
          Before joining the club, I had never done Ballroom Dancing before, but the club was very welcoming and
          I had lots of fun learning the different types of dance. I also made many friends in the club and I am
          happy to now be helping out with the Club. I hope that everyone considers joining the Ballroom Dance Club,
          as it is a great experience!

          Despite being involved in jazz band before joining the Ballroom club, 
          I’d never learned how to dance to the music I’d so often played. In 
          my first year of university I found the club to be a great way to 
          meet new people, step out of my comfort zone, and become part of a 
          warm community. There’s something in dance for everyone, in addition 
          to a skill that surpasses the ages.

          I waited until my second year at UVic to join Ballroom and I wish I 
          had joined sooner! Prior to joining the club, my dance experience 
          consisted solely of line dancing and two stepping. But everyone was 
          so welcoming and it didn't take long for me to fall in love with both 
          Ballroom and Salsa. Now, hopefully I'll have the chance to welcome 
          you to the club this year!

          I transferred to UVic as a second year student last year and
          joined the club as a way to meet new people and try new things. I
          had no previous ballroom experience and was only familiar with
          Lindy Hop. I can honestly say joining this club was one of the
          best decisions I’ve ever made. I’ve met some very interesting,
          fun people and have learned so much about myself in the process.
          This club is incredibly inclusive and it caters to dancers of all
          levels. Once you join this club you will be part of a community who
          loves meeting new people and share their love of dance. I look
          forward to meeting you all!

          This is my third year in the club and my first as part of the exec.
          I first joined the club to try something completely new to me. I
          had zero dancing experience before joining the club, but since
          then I've learned a lot and enjoyed it all the while, and I'm
          happy to now have the opportunity to give back to the club.
          Regardless of skill level, the club is a great place to come and
          have a good time. I hope to see you on the dance floor!

          I joined the UVic Ballroom Dance Club in my first semester. Before joining the club, I had danced ballet
          and musical theater, but it was the first time I tried social dancing, and I'm glad that I did. The more
          I learn about dance, the more I enjoy it, and I predict that you will too. The Ballroom Dance Club is filled
          with a wonderful and diverse group of people who would like to be your friend. Join us and dance away the
          stress of school!<br/><br/>

          There are short-cuts to happines, and dancing is one of them. - Vicki Baum

            Welcome to the UVic Ballroom Dance Club (UVBDC)!  As a Vikes Rec
            Club, we believe that ballroom dancing improves physical and social
            wellbeing and enhances quality of life! We offer lessons not only
            in Standard Ballroom (like waltz, foxtrot, and tango), but also
            Latin Ballroom, East Coast Swing, Salsa, Merengue and Bachata.
            You don’t need a partner or any dance experience
            (having two left feet is fine), just show up and get ready to have
            fun, meet new people, and, of course, learn how to dance!.
