          This will be my third year as a member of the UVBDC and my second as an executive. Over the past few years, 
          I have met so many wonderful people, challenged myself by joining the UVic Salsa Team, and just had a lot of fun! 
          I hope I will have the chance to welcome you to our club this year.

          Despite being involved in jazz band before joining the Ballroom club, 
          I’d never learned how to dance to the music I’d so often played. In 
          my first year of university I found the club to be a great way to 
          meet new people, step out of my comfort zone, and become part of a 
          warm community. There’s something in dance for everyone, in addition 
          to a skill that surpasses the ages.

          Dancing is so much fun! You're out with people, hearing music and learning
          a way to express yourself and feel as though you were a part of the music, 
          or in sync with your partner, and it's amazing. It's hard to explain it until 
          you feel it, but as soon as you start getting some of the basic steps and you
          get out there and fly around the ballroom or let your body move to Latin music,
          you feel connected and alive and it's a beautiful thing. I wish everyone could 
          experience dance and have fun with it. I had no dance experience coming in and 
          I've definitely learned a lot, but it just let's you realize how much more there 
          is! But at any level and any time, dancing is freeing and it's a wicked stress 
          relief too, where you get to laugh and enjoy yourself with all the other dancers.

          I joined the UVic Ballroom club in the first year of my university and fell in love 
          after I took my first class. I had never danced before and being an international
          student it was an amazing experience to not only learn dancing but to meet people 
          similar to you who love it. The ballroom dancing club is the perfect place 
          to learn some great skills, having fun in social dancing and always having a great
          time with everyone. Join the UVic ballroom club and dance your troubles away.

          This is my third year in the club and my first as part of the exec.
          I first joined the club to try something completely new to me. I
          had zero dancing experience before joining the club, but since
          then I've learned a lot and enjoyed it all the while, and I'm
          happy to now have the opportunity to give back to the club.
          Regardless of skill level, the club is a great place to come and
          have a good time. I hope to see you on the dance floor!

          I joined the UVic Ballroom Dance Club in my first semester. Before joining the club, I had danced ballet
          and musical theater, but it was the first time I tried social dancing, and I'm glad that I did. The more
          I learn about dance, the more I enjoy it, and I predict that you will too. The Ballroom Dance Club is filled
          with a wonderful and diverse group of people who would like to be your friend. Join us and dance away the
          stress of school!<br/><br/>

            Welcome to the UVic Ballroom Dance Club (UVBDC)!  As a Vikes Rec
            Club, we believe that ballroom dancing improves physical and social
            wellbeing and enhances quality of life! We offer lessons not only
            in Standard Ballroom (like waltz, foxtrot, and tango), but also
            Latin Ballroom, East Coast Swing, Salsa, Merengue and Bachata.
            You don’t need a partner or any dance experience
            (having two left feet is fine), just show up and get ready to have
            fun, meet new people, and, of course, learn how to dance!.
