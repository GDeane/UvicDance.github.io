          I have always loved music, and before getting into dance, I could often be found practicing the trombone, singing karaoke, or just jamming out to my favourite tunes.
          When I was in my first year of university, I joined the club because of my interest in swing dancing. 
          As fun as that was, I found myself entirely captivated by salsa, and before I knew it, I was coming exclusively to the UVic Salsa Performance Team!
          I have now found my passion in dance and I am on dance teams that give me the opportunity to dance several hours every day, as well as travel around the world to perform.
          Even if you don't have a musical background, this club is absolutely worth joining! <br><br>
          I hope to see you on the dancefloor!

          Hi everyone, I’m Alex, a second year Electrical Engineering student. 
          This is my second semester with the club and my first on the executive team. 
          I only had marginal dance experience before joining the club although lots of experience in sports. 
          With dance, I have improved my physical coordination and confidence. 
          I felt safe and welcomed by the club and the executive team when I first started dancing. 
          On my first day of free classes with the club when everything was online I loved it so much that I immediately bought the membership.

        Hi! I’m a third year microbiology student at UVic, and this is my second year with the club.
          Joining the UVic Ballroom, Latin, and Swing Club was one of the best decisions I ever made! 
          I’ve always wanted to learn to dance, but never had the time or opportunity to… fortunately these classes fit in a busy schedule and are so much fun! 
          It’s been a great way to relax and meet many interesting people. 
          So whether you've danced before or not, we welcome you to come and give it a try!

            Welcome to the UVic Ballroom, Latin, and Swing Club (UVBLSC)! As a Vikes Rec
            Club, we believe that ballroom dancing improves physical and social
            wellbeing and enhances quality of life! We offer lessons not only
            in Standard Ballroom (like waltz, foxtrot, and tango), but also
            Latin Ballroom, East Coast Swing, Salsa, Merengue and Bachata.
            You don’t need a partner or any dance experience
            (having two left feet is fine), just show up and get ready to have
            fun, meet new people, and, of course, learn how to dance!.
